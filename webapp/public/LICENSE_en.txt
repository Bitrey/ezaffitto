Welcome to ezaffitto.com, the website that allows you to easily find rental listings in Bologna. The website is managed by Alessandro Amella, email info@bitrey.it (hereinafter referred to as "the Owner").

This document contains the terms and conditions that govern the use of the ezaffitto.com website (hereinafter referred to as "the Site") by users accessing it (hereinafter referred to as "Users"). Please read this document carefully before using the Site. By accessing the Site, Users agree to be bound by these terms and conditions.

Purpose of the Service
The Site offers Users the possibility to freely consult rental listings in Bologna published on various third-party websites, such as Facebook, Subito.it, Bakeca, and ZappyRent (hereinafter referred to as "the Source Sites"). The Site does not directly publish the listings but automatically collects them from the Source Sites and saves them in a database, creating a repository for rental listings in Bologna. The Site has no direct relationship with the owners or intermediaries of the properties featured in the listings, nor with Users interested in them. The Site merely provides Users with an informational and search service.

Limitation of Liability
The Owner assumes no responsibility regarding the accuracy, correctness, timeliness, completeness, or legality of the listings published on the Source Sites and reproduced on the Site. The Owner does not conduct any prior or subsequent checks on the listings, nor does it verify the quality, safety, or legality of the properties featured in the listings. The Owner does not guarantee in any way the availability or suitability of the properties featured in the listings, nor the good faith or reliability of the owners or intermediaries thereof. The Owner is not a party to any rental contracts potentially concluded between Users and the owners or intermediaries of the properties featured in the listings.

Users are therefore invited to personally verify the information contained in the listings before taking any action based on them. Users are solely responsible for their decisions regarding the properties featured in the listings and the consequences arising from them. Users are aware that the Site does not provide any guarantee or protection in case of disputes or issues related to the properties featured in the listings or the rental contracts potentially concluded.

The Owner assumes no responsibility for the operation of the Site or the continuity of the service offered.
