1. Purpose of the Service

The Site offers Users the possibility to freely browse rental listings in Bologna published on various third-party websites, such as Facebook, Subito.it, Bakeca, and ZappyRent (hereinafter referred to as "Source Sites"). The Site does not directly publish the listings but automatically collects them from the Source Sites and saves them in a database, creating a repository for rental listings in Bologna. The Site has no direct relationship with the owners or intermediaries of the properties listed, nor with Users interested in them. The Site merely provides Users with an informational and search service.

2. Limitation of Liability

The Owner assumes no responsibility for the accuracy, correctness, timeliness, completeness, or legality of the listings published on the Source Sites and reproduced on the Site. The Owner does not conduct any prior or subsequent checks on the listings, nor does it verify the quality, safety, or legality of the properties listed. The Owner does not guarantee in any way the availability or suitability of the properties listed, nor the good faith or reliability of the owners or intermediaries. The Owner is not a party to any rental agreements that may be concluded between Users and the owners or intermediaries of the properties listed in the advertisements.

The Site does not offer any intermediary, advisory, or assistance services to Users who want to contact advertisers or rent the properties shown in the rental listings. Users wishing to contact advertisers or rent properties listed in the rental listings must do so directly through the Source Sites from which they originate.

Users are therefore encouraged to personally verify the information contained in the listings before taking any action based on them. Users are solely responsible for their decisions regarding the properties listed and the consequences arising from them.

We do not guarantee that the Site is free from errors, defects, viruses, malware, or other harmful elements. We do not guarantee that the Site meets your expectations or requirements.

We reserve the right to suspend, limit, or terminate your access to the Site at any time and without notice if we believe that you have violated these terms and conditions or any other applicable rules.
